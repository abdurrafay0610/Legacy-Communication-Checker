# ðŸ§ª Legacy Communication Testing Tool

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Legacy Communication Testing Tool** is a simulation-based testing utility designed to validate the communication behavior of legacy systems. These systems often communicate using **UDP** or **Serial (RS-232/RS-485)** protocols, which can be hard to test with modern infrastructure.

This tool simulates the expected communication behavior of counterpart devices, allowing seamless **functional testing**, **fault injection**, and **protocol conformance** verification.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- âœ… Simulates **UDP** and **Serial** communication protocols.
- âœ… Supports configurable **packet definitions** with custom validation (e.g., checksum, CRC).
- âœ… Automates sending/receiving of byte sequences.
- âœ… Validates device response based on expected behaviors.
- âœ… Includes support for **nested packets** (packets within packets).
- âœ… CLI interface for test integration and scripting.

## ðŸ“¦ Packet Definition Format

Packet definitions are stored as `.json` files and must follow a strict structure. These definitions are used to construct, send, and validate simulated communication packets.

### âœ… Required Fields

Each packet definition must contain:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `"Packet Name"` | `string` | Name identifier for the packet. |
| `"Packet Validation Scheme"` | `string` | The checksum or validation type. Must be one of: `["CHECKSUM", "REVS_CHECKSUM", "CRC16_LSB_MSB", "CRC16_MSB_LSB"]` |
| `"values"` | `dict` | A dictionary where keys are index positions and values are one of the following: <br> â€¢ List of possible byte values <br> â€¢ Dict (to nest another sub-packet) |

### ðŸ“Œ Example Packet Definition

```json
{
  "Packet Name": "Heartbeat",
  "Packet Validation Scheme": "CHECKSUM",
  "values": {
    "0": [0xAA],
    "1": [0x01, 0x02, 0x03],
    "2": [0xFF],
    "3": {
      "Packet Name": "SubPacket",
      "Packet Validation Scheme": "CHECKSUM",
      "values": {
        "0": [0x10],
        "1": [0x20, 0x21]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”Ž Notes on Value Types

- `values[i]` can be:
  - A **list**: defines possible byte values at index `i`.
    - `'X'` (optional) can be used to denote full byte range [0â€“255].
  - A **nested dictionary**: defines a sub-packet at index `i`.

- Each packet is built by selecting one random value from each index's list. Sub-packets are processed recursively.

- The tool appends authentication bytes (e.g., checksum) based on the selected validation scheme.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Simulate communication over UDP
python simulate.py --mode udp --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --send ./Packets\ Definition/Heartbeat.json

# Simulate communication over Serial
python simulate.py --mode serial --port COM3 --baudrate 9600 --send ./Packets\ Definition/Heartbeat.json
```

## ðŸ”„ Define Your Own Packet

You can define packets programmatically using:

```python
from packet_builder import define_packet, save_packet_definition

packet = define_packet(
    name="CustomPacket",
    values={0: [0x10], 1: [0x20, 0x30], 2: [0xFF]},
    packet_validation_scheme="CHECKSUM"
)

save_packet_definition(packet)
```

## ðŸ§ª Health Check

All packets go through a health validation process to ensure:
- Proper structure and field types
- Valid checksum scheme
- Sub-packets (if any) are also well-formed
